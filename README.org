* A JastAdd AST mode for Emacs

[[https://melpa.org/#/jastadd-ast-mode][file:https://melpa.org/packages/jastadd-ast-mode-badge.svg]]

[[http://jastadd.org/][JastAdd]] is a meta-compilation system that supports Reference Attribute
Grammars (RAGs).

This mode provides light support for editing of JastAdd AST definition files
for the Emacs editor.  Currently, this means syntax highlighting, comment
support and navigation to definitions via imenu.

Note that this mode only handles =.ast= files; to edit =.jadd= and =.jrag= files, check out [[https://github.com/lu-cs-sde/jastadd-mode][jastadd-mode]].

** Installation

You can install the package from melpa via =M-x package-install=.

To install from a local checkout, use John Wiegley's excellent [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package jastadd-ast-mode
  :load-path "~/Source/jastadd-ast-mode"
  :mode "\\.ast\\'")
#+END_SRC

(This assumes you cloned the repository at =~/Source/jastadd-ast-mode/=;
adjust to taste.)
